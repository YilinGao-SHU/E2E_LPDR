Existing license plate detection and recognition technologies can be categorized into two routes: two-stage and end-to-end. The end-to-end methods can achieve joint optimization and easier deployment, but they do not take the different image resolution requirements of the detector and recognizer into account, which impacts the overall performance. This paper presents a new cascade architecture based on a differentiable sample module to meet the diverse needs of both. Using the aforementioned module, the network is able to detect license plates on downsampled low-resolution images and resample them from the original high-definition images in order to recognize the license plate numbers. Furthermore, existing works demonstrate that the recognizer requires a broader Bounding Box than Ground Truth, whereas the optimization of the detection box itself requires the Bounding Box to be as close to Ground Truth as possible. Therefore, this paper introduces the Bias Detection Head, which decouples the two Bounding Boxes in order to escape this dilemma. Meanwhile, a novel feature fusion module is provided, to simultaneously satisfy the fusion of multi-scale information and the interaction between two Bounding Box features. For the recognizer, we presents a unified architecture based on a decoupled attention mechanism for recognizing tough examples of license plates, including single and double lines, varying lengths, and tilting.
